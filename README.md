> **FHE Encrypted Limit Orders on Uniswap v4**

**iceberg-cofhe** introduces confidential, iceberg-style limit orders to Uniswap v4 using [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)](https://fhenix.io/) via the [Fhenix coprocessor](https://cofhe-docs.fhenix.zone/docs/devdocs/overview). Limit order data like trade size and direction are encrypted on-chain and privately stored in the Iceberg hook   
â€” enabling privacy-preserving DeFi trading.

ðŸ”’ Built with FHE  
ðŸ¦„ Runs as a Uniswap v4 hook  
ðŸš€ Enables private, on-chain limit orders  

## ðŸŒŠ How It Works

- Users place encrypted limit orders through the hook (`placeIcebergOrder`) by providing encrypted values:
  - `liquidity`: order size
  - `zeroForOne`: swap direction
- Orders are stored in a privacy-preserving mapping, protected by FHE.
- In the `afterSwap()` callback the hook evaluates encrypted order conditions without leaking user intent.
- Once matching conditions are met, decryption is securely requested to fill the order.
- In the next `beforeSwap()` callback, the decryption result is requested.
  - If the decryption is ready, the order is filled.
  - Otherwise, the swap lifecycle continues
